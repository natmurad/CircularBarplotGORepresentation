# Circular barplot representing Gene Ontology Enrichment Analysis

## Author: Natalia Faraj Murad

This code creates a circular barplot representation of Gene
Ontology data from topGO enrichment analysis. This code was
adquired from https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/circular-barplot.html
and adapted for our data. This analysis is available on
Silva-Brandao et al (2020) Transcriptome differential co-expression 
reveals distinct molecular response of fall-armyworm strains to DIMBOA.
